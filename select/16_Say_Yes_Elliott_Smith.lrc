[00:04.20] I'm in love with the world
[00:07.43] Through the eyes of a girl
[00:10.85] Who's still around the morning after
[00:16.80] We broke up a month ago
[00:20.12] And I grew up, I didn't know
[00:23.62] I'd be around the morning after
[00:39.12] 
[00:41.95] It's always been wait and see
[00:45.32] A happy day and then you pay
[00:48.26] And feel like shit the morning after
[00:54.60] But now I feel changed around
[00:57.79] And instead of falling down
[01:00.95] I'm standing up the morning after
[01:17.45] 
[01:07.18] Situations get fucked up
[01:10.49] And turned around sooner or later
[01:19.85] And I could be another fool
[01:22.74] Or an exception to the rule
[01:25.84] You tell me the morning after
[01:40.34] 
[01:32.24] Crooked spin can't come to rest
[01:35.44] I'm damaged bad at best
[01:38.58] She'll decide what she wants
[01:44.54] I'll probably be the last to know
[01:47.81] No one says until it shows, see how it is
[01:56.07] They want you or they don't
[02:02.02] Say yes
[02:05.52] 
[02:04.32] I'm in love with the world
[02:07.14] Through the eyes of a girl
[02:09.96] Who's still around the morning after
