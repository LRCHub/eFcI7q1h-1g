No long is the darkest fate
No longer

It's the loose and banging gate
Which shook and broke with every slam
Is now a still and steady hand
Crouching on a whispering sand

Where time is still and nature's pure
It's hard to mirror a beautiful world
Rings from high snow caps
To the white soaked deserts
To the bar of decrepit future
This is where we heard

No longer is the darkest fate
No longer is the loose and banging gate
That shook and broke with every slam
Is now a still and steady hand
Crouching on a whispering sand
