Say yes and let's enjoy the winter
Say yes and celebrate community
Say yes to systems of resistance
Say no to international apathy
Oh yeah!

Celebrate and create
And give it all away
Don't you think you should
Always feel this way?
Don't be scared to go outside
And shout about it now
Don't you think that every day's the same?

And protest is a funny thing
When you want something real to sing
The rowdy ones are singing songs
But you know you can go wrong

Say yes to participation
Say yes to local youth club contributions
Say yes to unrequited love
Say no to the creeps at school
Who told you what you're working for

Go out, create, and don't wait
Don't give your dreams away
Don't you think it's great to be alive today?
Don't be scared to go outside
And shout about it now
Everyday another head turns grey

And protest is a funny thing
When you want something real to sing
The rowdy ones are singing songs
But you know you can go wrong
