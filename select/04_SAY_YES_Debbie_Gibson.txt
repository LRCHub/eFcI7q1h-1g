Sometimes I see that far away look in your eyes
Oh won't you talk to me and tell me what's been going on
Don't keep your feelings hidden inside
Well I want you to know
There's nothing I won't do for you
The world is a better place
When I see your face
Each day, oh it's true
I'm falling deeper in love with you
Now I need to know that you feel it too
There comes a time to cross a line
And make it real, so tell me what you feel

Now My heart is in your hand,
Tell me that you understand
All the joy and tenderness
We could share if you say yes
All the joy that we deserve
Is hanging on one single word
So come on won't you please say yes

Sometimes I say, your words belong to my daydream
Won't you throw the key for reaching you and make it real
I need the words filing my heart

Oh it's easy to see
You're holding me under your spell
The memory of your kiss
Lingers on my lips
So strong, Can't you tell
I want you save in my arms where you belong
I need your love from this moment on
Till the end of time
So speak your mind, if this is real
Just tell me how you feel

Now My heart is in your hand,
Tell me that you understand
All the joy and tenderness
We could share if you say yes
All the love that we deserve
Is hanging on one single word
So come on won't you please say yes

My destiny is (say yes)
So come on won't you (say yes)

Now My heart is in your hand,
Tell me that you understand
All the joy and tenderness
We could share if you say yes

Now my heart is in your hand
All the joy and tenderness
We could share if you say yes
All the love that we deserve
It's hanging on one single word
So come on won't you please say yes
Say yes. Say yes. Say yes. Say yes.
