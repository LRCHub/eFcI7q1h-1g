I love you so. But if you can't smile and say yes, Please don't cry and say no! When I ask for a date, the answer is no. You don't know what you're sayin'. Don't you know the war's on, Everything is rationed, How 'bout that jive, keep me alive? Baby, let bygones be bygones, 'Cause men are scarce as nylons. And if you can't smile and say yes, Please don't cry and say no! Baby, let bygones be bygones, 'Cause men are scarce as nylons. And if you can't smile and say yes, Please don't cry and say no, no, no, baby Please don't cry and say no.
